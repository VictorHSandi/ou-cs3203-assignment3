# Create a software program (in any language you wish) which contains a function / method which
# computes the sum of a list / array of numbers (integers, whatever you want) given as a parameter and
# returns the result. Commit the resulting file(s). If your language is a compiled language (i.e., one in
# which the source code is compiled into a different, binary format) then only commit the source code
# file.

# of all of a list / array of numbers given as a parameter and returns the result. Commit the result. The
# new function / method may be in the same file as part 1â€™s function / method, or a new file, but this
